## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Consolidated Components**: Moved from separate LeftPanel/CenterPanel/RightPanel files into single Play.jsx for better maintainability

2. **State Management**: All collapse states managed in single component, easier to persist to localStorage later

3. **Grid Layout**: Using CSS Grid instead of flexbox for better control and responsiveness

4. **Performance**: Proper overflow handling prevents layout shifts and performance issues

5. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation ready, ARIA labels prepared for next iteration
